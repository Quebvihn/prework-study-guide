# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Descrption

Welcome to my beginner software development project. In this project, I've created a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I've learned how to use GitHub to manage and version control my code. When doing the prework we realized that the prework has too much information to take in all at once so I created this website to keep all the information manageable and all in one place. This README will guide you through the project and provide instructions on how to get started.


## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
2. Open the Project: Navigate to the project directory using your preferred code editor.
3. Open index.html: Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the project.

## Usage

As a very beginner project what you can do is explore the contents of the notes taken from the prework and interact with the Chrome dev tools to see my progression in learning Javascript.
